            <p>Hi! My Name is Nadhirah Hannani Binti Mohd Nasri. I am 22 years old and I live at Wakaf Bharu, Kelantan. Most of the times people thought I am not an originally native Kelantanese due to my Kelantanese accent is not as fluent as other Kelantanese. In my family, I am the eldest children and also the eldest daughter. I have a brother who is four years younger than me. My hobby is singing and watching fantasy and comedy genre movies. Instead of cooking, I love to be the one who eats. I do enjoy spicy foods and love to try varieties of food especially chinese food. I am still a full time student who is also doing part time jobs at the same time. I am the type of who is easily bored but that is what made me become more open minded and ready to try new things until now.</p>
